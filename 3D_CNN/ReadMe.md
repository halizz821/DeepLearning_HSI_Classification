# 3D CNN for Hyperspectral Image Classification

This code classifies a hyperspectral image using a 3D convolutional neural network.

- Due to the large size of the hyperspectral image, I was unable to upload it. However, you can download it (Pavia Centre) with its ground-truth here: https://www.ehu.eus/ccwintco/index.php/Hyperspectral_Remote_Sensing_Scenes#Pavia_Centre_scene .
