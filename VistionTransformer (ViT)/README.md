# Vision Transformer for Hyperspectral Image Classification

![image](https://github.com/halizz821/DeepLearning_HSI_Classification/assets/135881986/9cb378e8-09a0-4a21-83c2-c526cf82031c)


This code classifies a hyperspectral image using a basic vision transformer model.

- This is an implementation of the paper "An Image is Worth 16x16 Words: Transformers for Image Recognition at Scale" [https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11929], with different hyperparameters.

- Due to the large size of the hyperspectral image, I was unable to upload it. However, you can download it (Indian Pines) with its ground-truth here: [https://www.ehu.eus/ccwintco/index.php/Hyperspectral_Remote_Sensing_Scenes#Pavia_Centre_scene].
